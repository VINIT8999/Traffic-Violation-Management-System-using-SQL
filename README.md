# Traffic Violation Management System (SQL)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Traffic Violation Management System** built using **MySQL** to practice real-world database design and SQL querying.  
It simulates how vehicles, drivers, traffic violations, and fine payments are stored and managed in a relational database.

The main focus of this project is **hands-on SQL learning**, not UI or application development.

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure
The database consists of the following tables:

- **vehicles** – stores vehicle details and registration info  
- **drivers** – stores driver personal and license details  
- **violations** – stores types of traffic violations and fine amounts  
- **violation_records** – maps drivers, vehicles, and violations  
- **payments** – tracks fine payment details  

All tables are connected using **primary keys and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.

---

## 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Used
- Database & table creation
- Primary and Foreign Keys
- INSERT, SELECT, WHERE
- ORDER BY, LIMIT
- INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
- Aggregation (SUM, COUNT)
- Conditional logic using `IF`
- Real-world data filtering (city-wise, date-wise, unpaid fines)

---

## 📊 Sample Queries Included
- Find unpaid traffic violations
- Retrieve vehicles by city
- View violations on a specific date
- Identify high-fine violations
- Calculate total fine revenue collected
- Join driver names with violation details
- Analyze violation count by location

---

## 🖼️ ER Diagram
The ER diagram was generated using **MySQL Workbench (Reverse Engineering)** and represents all table relationships clearly.

---

## 📈 Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in **relational database design**
- Improved understanding of **table relationships and joins**
- Learned how to write **practical SQL queries** used in real systems
- Practiced analyzing data using **filters, grouping, and aggregation**
- Understood how traffic violation data can be managed and tracked efficiently

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project helped strengthen my **SQL fundamentals** by working with a realistic dataset and real-world use cases.  
It demonstrates my ability to design databases, maintain data integrity, and extract meaningful insights using SQL queries.

While this is not a production-level system, it serves as a **strong learning project** and a solid foundation for more advanced database or backend development work in the future.
